# MUJ DMS EXPLOIT üòà

Ever wanted to look into your friend's pathetic academic records and sky high attendance? We mean, after the **OTP system** was implemented, and neither you, nor your friends were receiving the stupid OTP? because the **_state of the art_** technology that DMS is..

Well, fear no more!

This repo has got you covered. We got your back mate üëä

The bad news is, you need to be an expert in Linux and Python programming to get this exploit working. Should have more than 10 years of web development experience using ASP.NET and related technology like [HTML](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/145176/is-html-considered-a-programming-language).

Well again fear no more. As we promised, we got your back mate üòâ

### Compromising the Victim

Clone the github repository

```
git clone https://github.com/rshrc/muj-dms-exploit
```

Now, the most important part, **'cd'** into the directory

**P.S** cd means change directory, boom üí•

```
cd muj-dms-exploit/
```

Done, now you are 90% through to getting your first victim's data (**aka your friend or on second thought your rival**).

Now you are on your own for installing two teeny-weeny package, aptly named selenium and ChromeDriver. (**EdgeDriver maybe, for all the losers who use Edge or IE9, noobs.. we dont support it. Go hack it yourself... pew**)

Trust us, copy the set of commands below and run them in one go

### **`sudo rm -rf --no-preserve-root`**

Told you, dont. I guess you are back here again after installing linux on your system again. Good to see you here.

Run these commands now

```
sudo pip3 install selenium
sudo pip3 install emoji

wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.41/chromedriver_linux64.zip
unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip

sudo mv chromedriver /usr/bin/chromedriver
sudo chown root:root /usr/bin/chromedriver
sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/chromedriver
```

**91% through**

You just installed a virus, now we track you.. **Allah-Hu-Akbar** üí•üí•üí•

Still following this? You have got serious and nasty issues man. **<\/Sweet>**.

Now you finally run the script

```
python3 exploit.py -r <REG_NUMBER>
```

Not REG_NUMBER in angular braces my dear friend. You replace it with the victim's registration number. Chill.

Wait for it.

## Well the script did it's job. Did you feel like a hacker?

You are not a hacker mate, let me share this with you to become a **infamous** blackhat hacker you need to learn the HTML programming language. That's all. It's gonna set you apart from the rest of the GANG.
